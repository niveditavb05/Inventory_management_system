inventory management system using netbeans

This software, “Inventory Management System”, is used for recording the
information about the day to day transaction of stocks of an organization. It stores
purchase information of the products with credit/debit information from the
supplier. Similarly, it stores sales information with credit/debit about the
customers. If a product is purchased, then the related information is stored in
stocks, that is, stocks are up to date. Another part is it prepares sales report after
product is sold. In the sales information, the information about who sold the
product is also kept, so there is no problem for misunderstandings in future
